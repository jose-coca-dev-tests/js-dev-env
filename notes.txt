EXECUTE EXPRESS SERVER
- execute: > node buildScripts/srcServer.js
SHARE SERVER ONLINE:
- install > npm install localtunnel -g
- execute: > node buildScripts/srcServer.js
- execute as admin: > lt --port 3000 --subdomain josecoca
- open the provided link: https://josecoca.loca.lt/

EXECUTE CONFIGURED SCRIPT
- > npm run start  OR > npm start
- by convention "prestart" scripts are executed before "start" scripts, and so "poststart", and other script names
- execute configured scripts in parallel in only one terminal: > "parallelConfiguredScript": "npm-run-all --parallel script1 script2"

MODULE LOAD
- After load index.js and myLib.js we get on the console: "index.js is loaded!!, from lib: 123456"
- Inspecting the debugger tab we can see the two javascript files just as they exist in ./src/
- After load bundle.html we get on the console: "indexBundler.js is loaded!!, from lib: 123456"
- Inspecting the debugger tab we can see only one javascript file "bundle.js" which bundles the code of both indexBundler.js and myLib.js

EXECUTE LINTING
- execute: > npm run lint, we will get warnings for console.log lines
- eslint rules can be disabled for a whole file with a comment at the top: /* eslint-disable no-console */
- eslint rules can be disabled for specific line with a comment at the end of the line: // eslint-disable-line no-console
- eslint is configured to execute and watch files in command "start", every time the application is executed the eslint will watch files and show results

TESTS
- execute: > npm test  OR > npm run test

HTTP CALLS
- the users mock service can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/users
- the list of users is at http://localhost:3000/bundle.html
- generate mock data at src/api/db.json : > npm run generate-mock-data
- start the json server mock api: > npm run start-mockapi
- open the users list at the mock api: http://localhost:3001/users
- the mock file will be generated every time before start the mock api server
- the mock data will be generated and the server started along with the application start

PRODUCTION BUILD
- process.env.NODE_ENV can be used by babel and other libs
- production build is generated in folder dist
- run production build from local with mock API: > npm run build   open: http://localhost:3000/bundle.html
- run development build: > npm run start   open: http://localhost:3000/   and   http://localhost:3000/bundle.html
