SHARE SERVER ONLINE:
- install > npm install localtunnel -g

EXECUTE CONFIGURED SCRIPT
- > npm run start  OR > npm start
- by convention "prestart" scripts are executed before "start" scripts, and so "poststart", and other script names
- execute configured scripts in parallel in only one terminal: > "parallelConfiguredScript": "npm-run-all --parallel script1 script2"

MODULE LOAD
- After load index.js and myLib.js we get on the console: "index.js is loaded!!, from lib: 123456"
- Inspecting the debugger tab we can see the two javascript files just as they exist in ./src/
- After load bundle.html we get on the console: "indexBundler.js is loaded!!, from lib: 123456"
- Inspecting the debugger tab we can see only one javascript file "bundle.js" which bundles the code of both indexBundler.js and myLib.js

EXECUTE LINTING
- execute: > npm run lint, we will get warnings for console.log lines
- eslint rules can be disabled for a whole file with a comment at the top: /* eslint-disable no-console */
- eslint rules can be disabled for specific line with a comment at the end of the line: // eslint-disable-line no-console
- eslint is configured to execute and watch files in command "start", every time the application is executed the eslint will watch files and show results
